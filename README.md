# GitHub Repository: `nim-misc`

## What is this repository for?

The repository contains miscellaneous programs and code written in the [Nim
programing language](https://nim-lang.org/) that don't belong elsewhere.

They are often just useful snippets of code, or small programs written to
complete a quick task, but have not been developed further, or turned into
a program that warrants its own separate repository.
